# Amazon

Python script that tracks Amazon prices. 

In this case I hava hardcoded an URL to track the price of a Nintendo Switch. 

When the price goes under $210 I will receive an email.

Uses the smtp library for handling email connection, beautiful soup for web scraping and requests to make the HTTP request to the server.
